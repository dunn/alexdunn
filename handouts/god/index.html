Otherwise you would be creating something from nothing, which Descartes thinks is impossible.</p> <p>Now Descartes claims that this principle applies to ideas as well:</p> <blockquote> <p>The ideas in me are like images which can easily fall short of the perfection of the things from which they are taken, but which cannot contain anything greater or more perfect.</p> </blockquote> <p>My ideas of imperfect things might be cobbled together from imperfect sources (my imagination, or even myself), but an idea of absolute perfection cannot. It needs a perfect source.</p> <p>Do I have such an idea?</p> <h3 id="the-perfect-idea:afd8e37cb368a558dd064ba52f8ae3b9">The Perfect Idea</h3> <blockquote> <p>How could I understand that I &hellip; lacked something &hellip; that I was not wholly perfect, unless there were in me some idea of a more perfect being which enabled me to recognize my own defects by comparison?</p> </blockquote> <p>I think what Descartes is getting at is something like this:</p> <ul> <li><p>I can recognize imperfections in myself.</p></li> <li><p>To do that, I must have an idea of something <em>relatively more</em> perfect than I am. Call that relatively more perfect thing &ldquo;Dog&rdquo;.</p></li> </ul> <p>Now we are faced with a question: is Dog absolutely perfect, or only relatively more perfect than me?</p> <ul> <li><p>Is Dog absolutely perfect? Then I have an idea of something absolutely perfect.</p></li> <li><p>Is Dog <em>not</em> absolutely perfect? If I can determine that Dog is not absolutely perfect, then I must be able to recognize imperfections in Dog. <em>To do that</em>, I must have an idea of something relatively more perfect than Dog. Call that relatively more perfect thing &ldquo;Dogg&rdquo;.</p></li> </ul> <p>Now we are faced with the same question again. Is Dogg absolutely perfect, or only relatively more perfect than Dog?</p> <p>Descartes claims that if we keep asking ourselves this question, eventually we will be forced to admit that we really do have an idea of something absolutely perfect.</p> <hr/> <p>Now put this together with our No-Something-From-Nothing principle from above. An idea of absolute perfection must have come from something absolutely perfect. We have an idea of absolute perfection, which means there is something absolutely perfect. Descartes believes that God is whatever is absolutely perfect, so he considers this to be a proof of the existence of God.</p> </section> <footer class="single handouts"> <p>Posted on <time datetime="2014-02-06 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">6 February 2014</time>.
