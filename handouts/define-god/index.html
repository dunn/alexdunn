For historical and socioligical reasons, most of the philosophers of religion in Western departments are Christian or come from a culture heavily influenced by Christianity; that&rsquo;s why the God we use in our discussions is most similar to the Judeo-Christian God of the Old and New Testaments.</p> <p>We&rsquo;re <em>not</em> trying to insist that the Judeo-Christian God exists, or even that it&rsquo;s more likely that this God exists rather than another god or set of gods. Unfortunately most of us just aren&rsquo;t familiar enough with other religions to discuss them in detail.</p> <hr/> <p>But even within the Judeo-Christian tradition there are many different views about what God is like. The God of the Old Testament seems to be more jealous and vengeful than the God depicted in the New Testament, and some believers emphasize the former or the latter depending on their belief about what God <em>should</em> be like.</p> <p>An extreme example on one end would be the Westboro Baptist Church. But just because they are Christians and hold those views, doesn&rsquo;t mean that any other Christians have to share them. And of course, most don&rsquo;t. Some hold related but much less vicious views about things like homosexuality citing various passages of the Bible, while many Christians believe that there is nothing in their faith that compels them to discriminate against people whose sexuality and gender differ from the norm.</p> <p>Lots of atheists assume that because they read a certain passage of the Bible critical of homosexuality, or because their religious relative are against abortion, that being critical of homosexuality and being against abortion is part of what it <em>means</em> to be Christian. The philosopher Michael Ruse, who really ought to know better, published an article recently called <a href="http://blog.oup.com/2015/01/atheism-moral-issue/">Atheism: above all a moral issue</a> in which he said this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Abortion, gay marriage, civil rights&mdash;all of these thorny issues and more are moral and social issues at the heart of our lives and what you believe about God is going to influence how you decide.</p> </blockquote> <p>But that&rsquo;s totally not true; there are lots of Christians, Jews, Muslims, etc. who support access to abortion, and there are atheists who don&rsquo;t. The same goes for those others issues. The reason why is that being a Christian really doesn&rsquo;t require anything more than belief in what Professor Hess called the Supernatural Worldview:</p> <ol> <li><p>God exists and is morally perfect, all-powerful, and all-knowing. God is spirit (not material). There are no other gods.</p></li> <li><p>The World consists of God and his creation. Some of creation is immaterial and some of it is material.</p></li> <li><p>God is the explanation for why there is something rather than nothing. There is something because God has always existed and must exist (just as two plus two must equal four). The universe and everything else besides God were created by God at some point in the past.</p></li> <li><p>Humans were created by God to love, serve, and enjoy him forever. So, humans have a purpose. Humans have the free will to love and serve God or not. Human history is nothing more than the working out of the consequences of the fact that some people have chosen to do what they were created to do and some have chosen to not do what they were created to do.</p></li> </ol> <p>You could probably be a Christian and reject (4), maybe even (3). Christians and atheists both like to add requirements to being a good Christian&mdash;the Christians do it so that in order to be a good person at all, you need to be Christian, while the athiests try to show that you <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be a good person if you&rsquo;re a Christian.</p> </section> <footer class="single handouts"> <p>Posted on <time datetime="2015-01-15 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">15 January 2015</time>.
