<h2>Zombies!</h2>


<h3 id="toc_0">These zombies only eat brains if we do</h3>

<p>So a zombie is something that&rsquo;s physically indistinguishable from a
human but has no <em>mental states</em>.</p>

<p>Other, maybe less precise ways of getting at this, would be to say
that zombies are not <em>conscious</em>, or that there&rsquo;s <em>nothing going on up
there.</em> (Of course there are lots of physical things going on up
there, but no consciousness.)</p>

<p>But even though zombies don&rsquo;t have any mental states, they <em>act as if
they do</em>.  In the same sorts of situations where we would laugh, cry,
and so on, they would laugh, cry, and so on.  But here&rsquo;s the
difference:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When <em>we</em> laugh, it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re happy or amused.  When <em>zombies</em>
laugh, it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re in a situation that would make a human
happy, and because they&rsquo;re built to laugh when they&rsquo;re in a
situation that would make a human happy.</p></li>

<li><p>When <em>we</em> cry, it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re sad.  When <em>zombies</em> cry, it&rsquo;s
because they&rsquo;re in a situation that would make a human sad, and
because they&rsquo;re built to cry when they&rsquo;re in a situation that
would make a human sad.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Zombies can also act <em>as if</em> they remember things.  When <em>we</em>
remember, we&rsquo;re retrieving information that&rsquo;s stored <em>physically</em> in
the brain.  The zombie brain has this information too, so the zombie
can utter things like &ldquo;I remember sliding down that hill as a child&rdquo;
when they&rsquo;re in a situation that would make a human remember sliding
down that hill as a child.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">How could this be???</h3>

<p>Now the question is, are zombies even <em>possible?</em>  You might think
that they&rsquo;re not.  You might think that</p>

<ul>
<li>crying because you&rsquo;re sad</li>
</ul>

<p>just <em>is</em></p>

<ul>
<li>crying because you&rsquo;re built to cry in the sort of situation you&rsquo;re
in.</li>
</ul>

<p>You might think those are just two ways of describing the same thing,
and that there&rsquo;s nothing <em>more</em> to being sad than being in a certain
physical state.  The argument might go something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We&rsquo;re sad when and only when we&rsquo;re in physical state <em>S</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Therefore, to be sad just <em>is</em> to be in physical state <em>S</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Since zombies are physically indistinguishable from us, and we are
sometimes sad, zombies are sometimes in physical state <em>S</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>But since to be sad just <em>is</em> to be in physical state <em>S</em>, zombies
are sometimes sad.</p></li>

<li><p>But sadness is also a mental state, so zombies can (and sometimes
do) have mental states.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We defined &lsquo;zombie&rsquo; as something that <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> have mental states.
Since we&rsquo;ve now arrived at the contradictory conclusion that zombies
<em>do</em> have mental states, our definition of &lsquo;zombie&rsquo; must have been
<em>logically inconsistent</em>&mdash;it allowed us to derive the contradiction
that zombies both do and do not have mental states.  &ldquo;Zombies exist&rdquo;
is therefore <em>logically impossible</em>, just as impossible as &ldquo;Round
squares exist.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">NOT SO FAST</h3>

<p>This is not a valid argument.</p>

<p>The weakest part of the argument is when we try to infer from (1) to
(2).  Just because I&rsquo;m sad in all and only those situations when I&rsquo;m
also in physical state <em>S</em>, why does that mean being sad <em>just is</em>
being in physical state <em>S</em>?  Suppose you could hypnotize a man or
condition him to get angry when and only when he hears Garrison
Keillor on the radio.  Would this mean that the man getting angry
<em>just is</em> the man hearing Garrison Keillor on the radio?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that in this special case, hearing Garrison Keillor is a
pretty important part of how this man gets angry, but <em>there&rsquo;s more to
it than that.</em></p>

<p>Likewise, being in physical state <em>S</em> is a pretty important part of
how and why we&rsquo;re sad, but you might think that there&rsquo;s more to it
than that physical state.</p>

<p>(Or you might not.)</p>
