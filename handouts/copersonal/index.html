Let the story be a rather narcissistic story: cut out all details about everything else except you. So the story begins with an infant (or perhaps a fetus). It describes the infant developing into a child and then an adolescent. The adolescent passes into young adulthood, then adulthood, middle age, and finally old age and death. Like all stories, this story has parts. We can distinguish the part of the story concerning childhood from the part concerning adulthood. Given enough details, there will be parts concerning individual days, minutes, or even instants.</p> <p>[There&rsquo;s a sense in which] persons are a lot like their stories. Just as my story has a part for my childhood, so I have a part consisting just of my childhood. Just as my story has a part describing just this instant, so I have a part that is me-at-this-very-instant (from page 1 of Ted Sider&rsquo;s <em>Four-Dimensionalism</em>).</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a pretty good explanation of what <em>person-stages</em> are. Sider uses &ldquo;parts&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;person-stages&rdquo;, but he&rsquo;s talking about the same thing. &ldquo;Parts&rdquo; might seem a lot more natural, but when we talk about the parts of a person we&rsquo;re usually talking about their <em>spatial</em> parts&mdash;my legs, my arms, my head. But right now we&rsquo;re interested in <em>temporal</em> parts&mdash;my childhood, my teenage years, my twenties. &ldquo;Person-stages&rdquo; makes it clear that we&rsquo;re not talking about legs and arms and heads.</p> <p>So the idea is that a person is a collection of person-stages. We are the sum of our (temporal) parts.</p> <p>Now, take any two random person-stages. Either they&rsquo;re part of the same &ldquo;collection&rdquo;, or they&rsquo;re not. Either they&rsquo;re part of the same person or their not. Either they&rsquo;re <em>co-personal</em> or they&rsquo;re not. (Those are three ways of saying the same thing.)</p> <p>Take my childhood and my twenties. They&rsquo;re part of the same person&mdash;me. But <em>why?</em> What <em>makes it true</em> that a child in the 1990s and a 20-something now are parts of the same story&mdash;parts of the same person? Why are they <em>co-personal?</em></p> <h3 id="bodily-continuity:b95ebeb102ec2bd00b2cbb21bec91062">Bodily Continuity</h3> <dl> <dt>Person-stages A and B are co-personal</dt> <dd>A and B have the same (i.e., numerically identical) body </dd> </dl> <p>My childhood and my twenties are part of the same person because they have the same body. It&rsquo;s not <em>qualitatively</em> identical—I&rsquo;ve grown, I&rsquo;ve had my wisdom teeth removed, I&rsquo;ve lost some blood—but it&rsquo;s <em>numerically</em> the same body.</p> <p>(How do we know it&rsquo;s numerically the same?)</p> <h3 id="soul-theory:b95ebeb102ec2bd00b2cbb21bec91062">Soul Theory</h3> <dl> <dt>Person-stages A and B are co-personal</dt> <dd>A and B have the same immaterial mental substance—the same soul </dd> </dl> <p>My childhood and my twenties are part of the same person because they share the same soul.</p> <h3 id="memory-theory:b95ebeb102ec2bd00b2cbb21bec91062">Memory Theory</h3> <dl> <dt>Person-stages A and B are co-personal</dt> <dd>A and B are appropriately linked by memory </dd> </dl> <p>My childhood and my twenties are part of the same person because I, in my twenties, have <em>true</em> memories of my childhood.</p> <p>(In my twenties I can&rsquo;t remember being 1 year old. Was that a different person?)</p> <h3 id="psychological-continuity-theory:b95ebeb102ec2bd00b2cbb21bec91062">Psychological Continuity Theory</h3> <dl> <dt>Person-stages A and B are co-personal</dt> <dd>A and B are psychologically continuous </dd> </dl> <p>My childhood and my twenties are part of the same person because the psychologies of the person-stages are connected in the right way. They&rsquo;re not connected directly—my teenage years are in between—but my twenties are connected to my teenage years which are connected to my childhood, and that&rsquo;s enough.</p> <p>(What sort of connection does there need to be? If the psychology of my twenties is very similar to the psychology of my teenage years, which in turn is very similar to that of my childhood, is that sufficient? Or is there something more than similarity connecting these person-stages?)</p> </section> <footer class="single handouts"> <p>Posted on <time datetime="2015-05-13 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">13 May 2015</time>.
